Description: Methods for model-based clustering of multinomial counts under the presence of covariates. Mixtures of multinomial logit models are used for this purpose. These models are estimated under  a frequentist as well as a Bayesian setup using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, respectively. The (unknown) number of clusters is selected according to the Integrated Completed Likelihood criterion (for the frequentist model), and estimating the number of non-empty mixture components using parallel overfitting mixture models (in the Bayesian case) which are allowed to switch states, after imposing suitable sparse prior assumptions on the mixing proportions.
